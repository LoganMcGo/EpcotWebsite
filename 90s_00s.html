                    <p>As the 1990s began, EPCOT Center was evolving. The optimistic futurism of the 1980s gave way to a more entertainment-focused approach, and by 1994, the park officially dropped "Center" from its name, becoming simply "Epcot."</p>
                    <p>This era marked a significant shift in the park's identityâ€”balancing its educational roots with new thrills and celebrations as it prepared to welcome the new millennium. Corporate sponsorships changed, attractions were reimagined, and Epcot began its transformation into the park we recognize today.</p>
