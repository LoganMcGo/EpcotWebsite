                    <p>My Epcot journey began in 2006 when I was just 3 years old. While my personal memories of those early trips are faint, they mark the beginning of a long-standing family connection to this unique park. From staying at Coronado Springs with my grandparents in 2006 to returning in 2008, these early visits laid the foundation for what would become an annual family tradition.</p>
                    <p>Through years of research and countless visits, I've witnessed Epcot's evolution from its more educational "edutainment" focus to today's more theme park-oriented experience. This page captures my personal journey with Epcot and the memories that have made it special.</p>
